Every web application is unique due to the fact that every web application does provide a different service. Every web application has its own specific UI (User Interface), processing logic, and data type. All three help form the web applications that we see today. Exploring these will give us a better inside look at how they run and what we can use to build our own web application. 

Let us start out with retail. Amazon.com is a website that allows individuals to purchase goods and have it shipped right to there house the next day. It also allows users to sell those goods to people around the world. Amazon uses its Amazon Relation Database Service for its database. This service has servers set up in different locations and allows users to use as much data as they need. A UI is tricky to get correct, especially for a website that targets young and old individuals. They get around this problem by offering a minimal search-oriented UI that accommodates both the new and the old users. Amazon uses Java, Python, Ruby and many others for its back end and front end.

YouTube is a service that allows a user to watch as many videos as they want and upload them. The website uses MySQL for its database and they store there data in different ways for example, when a client requests a video if the video is popular YouTube will pull it from there CDN (content delivery network) for faster load speed. While if the client requests something less popular YouTube will serve it from there back end servers and database. YouTube uses HTML5 for its front end and Java, and Python for its back end.

Wikipedia is the worldâ€™s largest encyclopedia and free. The website has its own servers in five different locations to host its database. The website does not have the best UI, that is due to the fact that they are not a private company and it needs approval before it can make major changes causing it to take longer. Most of Wikipedia's logic and processing is done with PHP and MariaDB. 

There are many different web applications out there that accomplish a different goal. We looked at a shopping web application, video streaming, and an information blog-style web application. Each one of these had its own unique ways to solve how to store their information in a database, how to build there front and back end, and how to display there UI. They all are great models and examples of how we can tailor our web application based on our needs.
